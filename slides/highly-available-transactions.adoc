== CAP theorem and ACID

* ACID recap
** atomicity
** consistency
** isolation
** durability

* CAP consistency is *not* ACID consistency
* CAP consistency is rather ACID isolation

[NOTE.speaker]

*Durability*::
  means the time when disk does `fsync` (leave some deeper technical details
  about disk writes aside). For transaction it means that data are written to some log
  and when system crashes it will be available when started again (we can re-read
  the log and restore data).
*Atomicity*::
  defines possibility to abort transaction and changes done by transaction
  in the system will be reverted to state before the transaction starts.
  Martin talks that it should be nicer to says `abortability`. +
  _Atomicity_ is about handling failures when does depend when they come from (system crash,
  network failures, some constraint was broken...). +
  _Atomicity_ is *not* about concurrency. Rather _Isolation_ is about concurrency -
  meaning parallel transaction works on the same piece of data.
*Consistency*::
  is to having the system in consistent state (moving from one to other one).
  _Consistency_ is a point of view of an application in fact. +
  _Consistency_ means fulfilling   invariants which could be defined in DB model
  but they could be outside of it too.
*Isolation*::
  is about concurrency. In perspective of this presentation the _Isolation_
  property is the most interesting. When talking about _ACID_ isolation it's meant
  _Serializability_ to be obtained.

* Although, at least by the ACID acronym, atomicity is not an “isolation”
  property, atomicity properties also restrict the updates visible to other transactions.

== Highly available transactions (HAT)

* composes models of transaction isolation (ACID) with transaction consistency (CAP)
  under one "diagram"
* classifies what of the transaction model is achievable in HA (high available)
** Serializability, Snapshot Isolation and Repeatable Read isolation are not HAT-compliant
** most other isolation levels are achievable with high availability

[NOTE.speaker]

Snapshot Isolation and Repeatable Read isolation are not HAT-compliant
because they require detecting conflicts between concurrent updates
(as needed for preventing Lost Updates or Write Skew phenomena),
which we show is unavailable.

However, Read Committed isolation, transactional atomicity (Section 5.1.2),
and many other consistency models from database and distributed systems are
achievable via algorithms that rely on multi-versioning and limited client-side caching.

For several guarantees, such as causal consistency with phantom prevention and ANSI Repeatable Read,
we consider a modified form of high availability in which clients “stick to”
(i.e., have affinity with) at least one server

Adya's work the definition is based on: http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/adya-phd.pdf (Weak Consistency: A Generalized Theory and Optimistic Implementations for Distributed Transactions, 1999)

== Terms

High availability::
 * "always on"
 * servers will not need to synchronously communicate with others
 * allows operations on any replica
Sticky availability::
 * clients always contact the same logical replica
 * whenever a client’s transactions is executed against a copy
   of database state that reflects all of the client’s prior operations, it
   eventually receives a response

== Terms (2)

Transactional availability::
 * transactions: groups of multiple operations over multiple objects
 * transaction has replica availability if it can contact
   at least one replica for every item it attempts to access
 * transactional avail ability if, given replica availability for every data item
   in a transaction, the transaction eventually commits
Sticky transactional availability::
 * A system provides if, given sticky availability, a transaction eventually commits
   or internally aborts

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* the other availability mode (HA, SA) is considering single-object, single-operation availability
--

== See section 5.1: Achievable HAT Semantics

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* a lot of the solutions is handled by passing some _cache_ on the client

Read Uncommitted::
 as PL-1, prohibiting dirty writes G0
- writes to each object are totally ordered, corresponding to the order installed to a DB.
In distributed database different replicas can receive writes in a different times
but should handle concurrent updates in accordance of the total order.
The read uncommitted is easily achieavable by marking each of the transaction's writes
with the same timestamp (unique across transactions) and applying 'last write wins'.

Read Committed::
 as PL-2 - standard dbs uses either long duration exclusive locks and short duration
read locks or multi-versioning.
Transaction should not access uncommitted or intermediate versions of data items.
This prohibits Dirty Writes (G0) and Dirty Reads (G1).
We can provide read committed if each client never writes uncommitted data to shared copies of data.
As naive solution client can buffer their writes until they commit, or alternatively
the server will not send uncommitted values to readers.

Repeatable Read::
 - ANSI standard definition is achievable by HAT but properties labeled with RR
spans a bit more in other definitions.
Standar def - if txn reads the same data more than once, it sees the same value each time
(preventing Fuzzy Reads (P2)). In this paper this property is called - `cut isolation`.
If this property is hold over reads from discrete data items then it's `item cut isolation`
and prevents Phantoms P3/A3.
We can have a transactions store copy where we store all read data by the client from the
database indexed by the txn id.

Although, at least by the ACID acronym, atomicity is not an "isolation" property, atomicity
properties also restrict the updates visible to other transactions.
Isolation effect of atomicity is Monotonic Atomic View (MAV) isolation.
Once some of the effects of transaction T1 are observed by another transaction T2,
then all effects of T1 are observed by T2.
MAV + cut isolaiton prevents Read Skew anomalies (Berenson, A5A). In Adya's hierarchy
the MAV is below PL-2L but above Read Committed (PL-2). MAV disallows reading intermediate writes (G1b).
MAV in one node DB is achievable by lightweight locking and/or local concurrency control over data.
In distributed system replicas can store all versions ever written each data item. Replica can
gossip info about versions and construct a lower bound on the versions that can be found on every replica
(represented by a vector clock). Clients starts by choosing a read timestamp.

Represented MAV algorithm here - Read Committed alg: Servers will not deliver their
value to other readers until notified that the writes have been committed.
+ replicas wait to reveal new writes to readers untill alll of the replicas for the final writes
in the transaction have received their perspective writes (are pending stable).
See other details in paper (5.1.2).

For session guarantee (all of a user's transactions submitted between log in and log out forms a session).

Monotonic reads::
subsequent reads in session to a given object "never return any previous value".

Monotonic writes::
each sessin's writes become visible in the order they were submitted.

Writes Follow Reads::
if a session observes an effect of transaction T1 and subsequently commits
  transaction T2, then another session can only observe effects of T2 if it can also observe
  effects of the T1. -> not achievable by HA but possible for sticky HA

Sticky HA permits three additionally guarantees

Read your writes::
client reads a given data item after updating it, the read returns
  the updated value (or a value that overwrote the previously written value)

PRAM (pipelined random access memory)::
illusion of serialization within each session
  combines monotonic reads, monotonic writes and read your writes

Casual consistency::
combines PRAM with writes-follow-reads, it's Adya's PL-2L.

Casual consistency::
is achievable for sticky hight availability with algorithms similar to MAV
  where only revealing new writes to clients when their (respective model-specific) dependencies
  have been revealed.
