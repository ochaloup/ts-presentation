* microservices, microservices, microservices - even my grandma program microservices
* how the microservice looks likes - data is close to the service, usually local
  data storage at the microservice
* what if we want to make some atomic action (something happens or nothing happens)
  which works over boundaries of single microservice
* ok, microservice boundaries are wrongly defined... but there is a niche where
  such 'thing' is needed, then what about transactions?
* will you tell me somebody what is a transaction?
* logical unit of work whole done or nothing done at all
* seems good, no ?
* step aside - I talk about JTA transaction, do you know that?
* what is ACID
* what is 2PC
* locks are everywhere - no scaling
* Saga saves us - maybe
* how that works
* what is Narayana LRA
* and demo
