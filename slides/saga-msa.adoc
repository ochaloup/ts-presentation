== Sagas

* Transactional model for long living transaction
* Saga paper (H. Garcia-Molina, K. Salem;  1987)
* Relaxing ACID properties
* Eventual consistent


== ACID vs. Saga

* One logical unit of work, everything or nothing happens

* ACID properties is a transaction guarantees
** Protecting shared resources from multiple users
** closely coupled environment
** short duration

* Saga
** loosely coupled
** long duration


== Sagas (#2)

image:{images}/saga/saga_confirm.png[role="noborder", .stretch]

* consists of a sequence of autonomous operations, each immediatelly visible to outer world
* responsibility of failures handling to developer (handlers)
* transaction manager is responsible for calling handlers


== Sagas (#3)

image:{images}/saga/saga_compensate.png[role="noborder", .stretch]

* compensation handler defined by developer, called by transaction manager

== Narayana LRA

* LRA: Long Running Actions
* Saga implementation for REST calls
* based on the MicroProfile stack (JAX-RS, CDI)
* https://github.com/jbosstm/microprofile-sandbox/tree/master/proposals/0009-LRA[LRA specification - microprofile proposal]

== Demo

== Summary

* Narayana LRA - implementation of Saga for REST calls
* better fit for MSA than ACID transactions
* a tool that can help in desiging the application
** MSA principles should be preserved
