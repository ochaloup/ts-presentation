== An ACID transaction

* One logical unit of work
** everything or nothing happens
** usually in regards of a data manipulation
* Protecting shared resources from multiple users
* ACID properties guaranteed


== Distributed transaction: 2PC

image:{images}/saga/2pc.png[role="noborder", .stretch]


== ACID transactions: assuming

* closely coupled environment
** harder to scale
** tight data coupling
* short duration
** locking reduces parallelism


== Microservice architecture: expecting

* loosely coupling
* scaling
* long duration for transaction


== Sagas

* Relaxing ACID properties
* Eventual consistency
* Saga paper (H. Garcia-Molina, K. Salem;  1987)

Original paper talks about Saga as a solution for long-lived database transactions.
We can use it for distributed environment too for not using two phase commit (a.k.a. locks).

A Saga consists of a sequence of operations, each could work with a resource.
Changes made by the operation on the particular resource are visible to the outer
world immediately. We can see it as a just group of operations (a.k.a local transactions)
which are executed one by one group by the Saga.
A Saga guarantees that either all operations succeed or all the work is undone
by compensating actions. The compensating actions are not generically provided
by a coordinator framework, instead, they have undone actions defined in business
logic by the application programmer.

Other names

* Saga action, Saga transactions
* Compensating transactions, compensation transaction
* long running actions, long lived transactions

== Sagas (2)

image:{images}/saga/saga_confirm.png[role="noborder", .stretch]

* consists of a sequence of autonomous operations, each immediatelly visible to outer world
* responsibility of failures handling to developer (handlers)
* transaction manager is responsible for calling handlers


== Sagas (3)

image:{images}/saga/saga_compensate.png[role="noborder", .stretch]

* compensation handler defined by developer, called by transaction manager

Standard ACID transaction is expected to be a short amount of work done in short time.
This expectation is based on the fact that ACID transaction holds resources (locks)
and prevents other concurrent transaction using the same data to proceed.

What if we want to have long transaction spans request over network (WS, REST)
combined with insertion to a database.
What if we consider popular example of reserving a flight, taxi to a hotel and the hotel,
which we would like to be a single operation in high level point of view - I mean
when I book a hotel from some date,
I need to be sure that the flight for that date is booked too and having taxi
on particular date being prepared for me. Confirmation of the hotel could take "long"
time and during that time I need to hold reservation for the flight. When booking fails
I need to cancel the flight reservation too. At this particular example
it's suitable to hold resources (locks) as it could block other reservation to happen.
