Concept of long lived transaction.

Standard ACID transaction is expected to be a short amount of work done in short time.
This expectation is based on the fact that ACID transaction holds resources (locks)
and prevents other concurrent transaction using the same data to proceed (mainly when the
both of them hit writing the same record, reading concurrently could be somehow solved by MVCC - Snapshot isolation).

What if we want to have long transaction spans request over network (WS, REST) combined with insertion to a database.
What if we consider popular example of reserving a flight, taxi to a hotel and the hotel,
which we would like to be a single operation in high level point of view - I mean when I book a hotel from some date,
I need to be sure that the flight for that date is booked too and having taxi on particular date being prepared
for me. Confirmation of the hotel could take "long" time and during that time I need to hold reservation
for the flight. When booking fails I need to cancel the flight reservation too. At this particular example
it's suitable to hold resources (locks) as it could block other reservation to happen.

This is really popular example in many articles and it is in fact real for many use cases.
But what I thing is important here is the fact that it points to the fact that
holding resources/locks (for long time) could be a bad fit which not permitting concurrent operation to proceed.
This is something with current systems which manages big amount of data and processing many operations in parallel
has to fight with.

Trend of holding locks is represented by well-known two phase commit protocol where
each resource - each participant of the transaction (it could be a database, WS/REST call, JMS...)
starts its own local transaction and that local transaction holds resources of particular system
(it holds locks on the resource, implementation depends system - in example of DB as mentioned
there is MVCC which does not lock for concurrent reads). The resource is hold during the whole time
of processing until commit is called on the local transaction.
When thinking about two phase commit from point of insertion of some data to a database we can imagine to be like

. application inserts data to database
. that starts a global `2PC` transaction managed by a transaction manager (e.g. Narayana)
. that started a local database transaction which (could) holds some locks and prevent other insertion (or possibly reads)
  being done on the influenced record by other operations (transactions) started later
. application sends a message to JMS queue
. the database local transaction is still active and locks are held
. application ends its business logic
. transaction manager starts two phase commit
. transaction manager asks the database if it can prepare
. the database responses 'yes' and stores the state of the local transaction durably
  (until now the crash of the database means losing information about the local transaction)
. transaction manager asks other participants if they can prepare (this time it asks the JMS broker)
. the database still locks the data influenced by the data insertion
. transaction manager directs the database to commit, database releases the locks now
. interestingly here we have a time windows when an global consistency is not fulfilled.
  defined in different way ACID consistency is fine as there is no contradiction of consistency
  constraints required by database but isolation in ACID way of thinking stretched over the whole
  global transaction is not valid in fact. This is just pointing to fact that `2PC` provides ACID atomicity
  but not the ACID isolation
. transaction manager commits other participants and global transaction ends

This example shows how the `2PC` holds resources which leads to the fact that resources
itself holds locks as part of its local transactions.

How to not holding lock and permit higher transaction throughput? The answer could be Saga.
Even we didn't define it so far we can say it comes with idea of splitting this big
transaction to small ones where each local transaction is finished as soon as possible
and the set of the already finished transactions defines a work of unit. This breaks
ACID isolation right at the place but Saga provides handling to grant atomicity.

The Saga defines unit of work work that could be aborted and we relax isolation.

As I tried to indicate the issue is the same - let through be higher, do not hold/lock.

== Saga

The concept of the original paper talks about single node database but it could
be applied to distributed transactions (as was already shown).

Saga could be classified as `Base` transaction (at least from my understanding)
as it does not lock resources a.k.a locks and letting data of resources being available
for other transactions to work with.

TODO: _add description of Saga here_

As you could see the transaction handling introduced by Saga requires the application to
define compensation actions or define actions as idempotent (you can repeat operation on the
resource multiple times and you will get the same result - operation being repeated not leading to a different outcome).

Still you can handle all the data integrity yourself in your application and design your system architecture
to handle with failures. It's up to you if concept of Saga is useful for you or not.

*State store*::
  State store corresponds with transaction manager object store (as Narayana implements it
  and as it's easily to be understand). State is saved in a storage (either in local disk
  or in some distributed environment). This storage has to be available during recovery.

*Routing slip*::
  The state corresponding with the saga state is send from one service to other. For example
  we want to add to one account and remove from other account, each in different service.
  Thus information that the Saga contains this two operations is sent in the message to the
  first service. It adds to one account and sends information that the Saga consists from two
  operations, where one is fulfilled by 'me'. If the second service fails to remove from the account,
  it sends a message with saga context to an error queue where the first service listen on
  and it handle compensations.

*Process manager*::
  It's what we label here as event driven transactions. There some messaging system where
  process manager listen on. The services could be informed about needs of add/remove to/from account
  from some service bus, queue or just async call but they send information about outcome to the msg system
  where process manager listen and it can manage compensation handling.
