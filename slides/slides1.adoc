== Transactions in Java !?

== Agenda
 * Terminology
 * Resource local transactions in Java SE
 ** Database
 ** JMS
 * Transactions in Java EE (on JBoss)
 ** Java Transaction API (JTA)
 ** Java Persistence API (JPA)
 ** Bean managed transactions (BMT)
 ** Container managed transactions (CMT)


= Terminology corner

== A transaction
A transaction is a group of business logic statements with certain shared properties.

Which are one or more of:

Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 The statement above stolen from presentation of Michael Musgrove for Brno JBug, January 2015
 From user point of view a transaction is an atomic unit of the work where everything or nothing is finished.
 From developer point - we have some data and we want to save them to some store and if there is something
  running in paralel with our task we want to be isolated/warned from colisions.
 All the presentation is about resources that could  be managed - resource is database, jms, mail service, whatever connected to JCA
 Concurrency access is the main reason why we need to discuss such thing as transaction.
 Transactions tries to make programmer's life easier to give him some assurances (zaruky)
--

=== ACID
 * Atomicity
 * Consistency
 * Isolation
 * Durablitity

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID, http://what-when-how.com/hibernate/transactions-and-concurrency-hibernate/
 Atomicity
  * one part of transaction fails then whole transaction fails
  * the notion that all operations are executed as an atomic unit
 Consistency
  * transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another according to defined rules (as constraints, cascades, triggers...)
  * by some definitions proclam that consistency should be maintained during the transaction execution as well (not only at transaction's ends) 
    what I understand it's ok to say that transaction keeps consistency for short lived ACID isolated transactions. but if transaction does not guarantee
    isolation then the consistency inside of transaction run could be important or rather violated
  * consistency means that a transaction works on a consistent set of data: a set of data that is hidden from other concurrently running transactions
     and that is left in a clean and consistent state after the transactions completes
  * does not mean correctness of transaction from business point of view
 Isolation
  * for transaction itself the system behaves like the paralel transactions would be run in serial order
  * concurrent execution of transactions results in a system state that would be obtained if transactions were executed serially (one by one)
 Durablitity
  * durability means that once a transaction completes, all changes made during that transaction become persistent and aren’t lost even if the system subsequently fails
--

== Other transaction "types"

 * BA (Business Activities)
 * BTP
 * WS-CAF
 * WS-TX (WA-AT and WS-BA)
 * Extended transactions
 * BASE

[NOTE.speaker]
--
  Resources
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR8_m5_k4fQ
  * http://www.infoq.com/articles/History-of-Extended-Transactions
  Extended transactions (in Narayana)
   * umbrella term for transaction systems/protocols which relax some of the ACID guarantees (properties)
   * from part of Narayana it's protocol based on Sagus (academic research from 1997)
   ** relaxes Isolation and Consistency (it's eventually consistent)
  BA - business activities
   * BA is term from "another" world - in general it's long terming transaction (booking a flight + taxi from the airport)
   * came along with WebServices
  BTP
   * Hewlett-Packard, Oracle and BEA worked on the OASIS Business Transaction Protocol (BTP), which was aimed at business-to-business transactions in loosely coupled domains such as Web Services
   * based on 2PC protocol in general
   * The specification developed two new models for "transactions", requiring business-level decisions to be incorporated within the transaction infrastructure
   * 2001
  WS-CAF
   * ASIS Web Services Composite Application Framework (WS-CAF) TC (Defining an open framework for supporting coordinated and transactional compositions of multiple Web services applications)
   * 2006
  WS-TX
   * ideas came from CORBA model (http://www.infoq.com/articles/History-of-Extended-Transactions)
   ** coordinator responsible for sending and receiving messages of arbitrary types - called signals
   ** coordinator inteligence - enabled for specific protocol with special sets of signals being transfered
   * WS-AT: atomic transactions - 2PC
   * WS-BA: businness activities doing compensation actions
  BASE
   * ACID transaction doesn't scale
   * connected with the movement of NoSQL
   * came with CAP theorem - system could satisfy just two of these three requirements: Consistency, Availability, Parition Tolerance
   * one of the way how to handle CAP "trouble" is relaxing consistency which is where BASE goes
   ** Basic Availability -  spread data across many storage systems with a high degree of replication
   ** Soft State. - data consistency is the developer's problem and should not be handled by the database, consistency is not a goal here
   ** Eventual Consistency - system will eventually become consistent once it stops receiving input
   * some of the NoSQL databases tries to be ACID(like) -> NewSQL - FoundationDB, NuoDB, OrientDB...
--

== Transaction types

 * Top-level
 * Nested
 * Nested top-level
 * Concurrent nested

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Types
 * Top-level transaction - transaction as we understand it
 * Nested - transaction contains other transaction. When nested rollbacks it does not mean that top-one will rollback. 
            If nested commits then the overall result depends on the top-level transaction.
 * Nested top-level - nested is invoked in context of another txn but if top-level commits 
                      it's commited independently on the outcome of the caller transaction.
 * Concurrently running nested transaction - result has to be the same as they would be run in arbitrary serial order
--

== Transaction types (contd.)

 * Resource local
 * Global transaction
 * Distributed transaction

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Txn management
 * Resource local - transaction at level of database or JMS server
 * Global - transaction "consisting" from several resource local transactions managed by transaction manager
 * Distributed transaction - transaction spread over multiple transaction managers
--

== XA vs. Distributed transaction

 * XA - XA/Open XA architecture - multiple resources
 * Distributed - multiple transaction managers

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 In many sources under term distributed transaction means XA from point of view of this presentation (and Narayana TM in general. 
 E.g. JDBC specification talks about distributed transactions but such txn means XA transaction from point of view of this presentation.
 Narayna/JBoss/EAP point of view understands distributed transactions such ones that pass its context over a to a different transaction manager.
 XA transaction is such that contains several resources, such specified by X/Open XA architecture - meaning transaction using 2PC protocol over more resources.
 This presentation won't be about neither XA or distributed transactions (maybe about distributed in sense of context passing between EJB beans)
--

== Transactions from developer point of view

 * Local transaction model
   `connection.commit`
 * Programmatic transaction model
   `transaction.commit()`
 * Declarative transaction model
   `@TransactionAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRED)`

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 * Local - working directly with resource/connection
 * Programmatic - not working with resource but with a transaction
 * Declarative - transactions are hidden behind of JEE layer
--

= Databases and JDBC

== Database transaction
[ source, language="sql" ]
----
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO test_table VALUES (1, 'test');
COMMIT;

 PostgreSQL "syntax"

== Isolation level

image:{images}/db/isolation-levels-base.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Resources
   * http://what-when-how.com/hibernate/transactions-and-concurrency-hibernate/#bookmark369
   * Java Transaction Design Strategy p53
 It's interaction of interleaving transactions
 Transaction isolation is a function of database cocurrency and database consistency - more isolation, means more consistency but less concurrency
 Hibernate increase level of isolation to moving control to application layer
  * optimistic locking adds versioning and so non-repeatable reads can't occur - meaning repeatable read isolation level is supported
     (or the special case when second commit replaces data of first commit)
  * pesimistic locking uses SELECT ... FOR UPDATE to lock particular record in database - this is other way how support read isolation level
     but it's hard support as the concurrent user has to wait till previous transaction will not release the resource
--

== Lost update

image:{images}/db/01-lost-update.jpg[]

[small]#shamelessly stolen from http://what-when-how.com#

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 two transactions doing update in parallel but first does commit and second rollbacks - then the commit of first willl be lost
--

== Dirty reads

image:{images}/db/02-dirty-reads.jpg[]

[small]#shamelessly stolen from http://what-when-how.com#

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 two transactions running in paralel. first does update and second shortly after that reads the same data - the update will be wisible
 despite the fact that the first transaction is rollbacked in a while
--

== Non-repeatable reads

image:{images}/db/03-non-repeatable-reads[]

[small]#shamelessly stolen from http://what-when-how.com#

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 when first transaction does two reads of some data already saved! in transaction - one after another - and between these two actions second transaction does commit
 the second read of the first transaction will get another data then the first read
--

== Phantom reads

image:{images}/db/04-phantom-reads.jpg[]

[small]#shamelessly stolen from http://what-when-how.com#

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 when transaction does select over more rows it could reads different count of rows in two subsequent queries when another transaction was meanwhile commited and
 added a row which is contained in the searched query
--

== Quiz
[ source, language="java" ]
----
java.sql.Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(...)
Statement st = connection.createStatement();
st.execute("INSERT INTO table VALUES (1, 'EAP QE')");
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Where is the transaction?
--

== Quiz - Answer
[ source, language="java" ]
----
java.sql.Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(...)
connection.setAutoCommit(false);
Statement st = connection.createStatement();
st.execute("INSERT INTO table VALUES (1, 'EAP QE')");
connection.commit();
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 The autocommit mode on connection was used. The update was reflected in database immediatelly when statement was executed.
 In this answer slide the update is reflected after commit is called - the transaction was explicitly stated by setAutoCommit(false)
--

== JDBC
 * Connection.setAutoCommit
 * Connection.setTransactionIsolation

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 * transactions are managed by Connection.setAutoCommit method
--

== JDBC batch
[ source, language="java" ]
----
java.sql.Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(...)
connection.setAutoCommit(false);
Statement st = connection.createStatement();
st.addBatch("INSERT INTO table VALUES (1, 'JTA')");
st.addBatch("INSERT INTO table VALUES (2, 'JCA')");
int[] updateCounts = st.executeBatch();
connection.commit();
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Some performance optimalizations for batching could be taken by database.
 But from test log there is no any special handling for simple cases as this one.
 There are just two inserts one after another.
 Butch return simple count of changes. It can't return ResultSet.
--

== JDBC "nested" transactions
[ source, language="java" ]
----
java.sql.Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(...)
connection.setAutoCommit(false);
Statement st = connection.createStatement();
st.execute("INSERT INTO table VALUES (1, 'EAP 6')");
Savepoint savePoint = connection.setSavepoint();
st.execute("UPDATE table SET product='EAP 7' WHERE id=1");
connection.rollback(savePoint);
connection.commit();
----

== Be aware of DDL commands
 * DDL - data definition language (CREATE, DROP...)
 * DML - data manipulation language (INSERT, UPDATE...)
 * lot of Databases does not support transactional DDL

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Resource:
 https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Transactional_DDL_in_PostgreSQL:_A_Competitive_Analysis
 PostgreSQL do DDL in transaction
 e.g. Oracle (probably - not up-to-date info) first commits currently running DML and then does DDL in separate transaction
--

= JMS

== Transactions and redelivery
image:{images}/jms/jms-transaction-redelivery.png[]


[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Resources: http://www.javaworld.com/article/2074123/java-web-development/transaction-and-redelivery-in-jms.html
 First - simplifiyng abilities of JMS
 Second - aim is that we want being safe thta message was really delivered
 * if message waits in queue (in JMS provider) then the its fate in case of failure depends on delivery mode: *persistent* or *nonpersistent*
 ** HornetQ settings: <persistence-enabled>true</persistence-enabled>
 * if message is being sent then acknowledgement that was received is driven by by transaction/redelivery modes
 * all this is set when *Session* is created
--

== Session creation
[ source, language="java" ]
----
Connection.createSession(boolean transacted, int acknowledgeMode)
----
 * `Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE`
 * `Session.DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE`
 * `Session.CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE`
 * `Session.SESSION_TRANSACTED`

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 If session is set as transacted = true then acknowledgeMode is ignored
 Or at least it should be - this is not true for Genereic JMS RA (Tibco and EAP)
 * commit() is called on Session (transacted=true)
 * acknowledge() is called Message (transacted=false, acknowledgeMode=CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE)
 AUTO - If a failure occurs while executing the receive() method or the onMessage() method, the message is automatically redelivered.
        The JMS provider carefully manages message redelivery and guarantees once-only delivery semantics.
 DUPS - With less overhead than auto mode, in duplicates okay mode, the JMS provider guarantees at-least-once message delivery.
        During failure recovery, certain messages are probably delivered more than once.
 CLIENT - In client mode, invoking the Message class's acknowledge() method explicitly acknowledges the message.
          In fact, using the acknowledge() method makes sense when only using the client mode.
--

== Quiz

What happens on JMS transaction rollback?

== Quiz - Answer
 * automatic redelivery rollbacked messages
 * redelivery count could be defined
 * redelivery timeout could be defined
 * exceptional destination (message is non-deliverable)
 ** message is only logged
 ** message is forwarded to an error destination
 ** message is forgotten

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 redelivery count - number of tries to deliver message, redelivery count is important as not deliverable messages can eventually crash the system
 redelivery timeout - time to wait before redelivering the message. This delay lets the JMS provider and the application recover to a stable state.
 when rollback it could be set whether rollbacked message goes to the end or to the front of the queue - it depends on some config etc.

 TODO: Ideas to check:
  * nested transactions
  * JTS and Corba - how to use it
--

== Quiz

What is the JTA/Transaction Manager for?

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 We know that we can manage database or jms resource directly why such thing is not
 covered by Java EE container and we need some specification of transaction?
 What that transaction for?
 What the JTA could offer to me?
--

== Quiz - Answer

 * Managing transactions :)
 ** High-level API that allows application and application server to demarcate transaction boundaries
 * Machinery of two phase commit protocol
 ** Java mapping of X/Open XA protocol
 * Recovery management
 * Timeout setting
 * Could force rollback-only behaviour
 * Distributed transactions

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 It's standardized way how container can communicate with transaction.
 Specialized thread (in background or foreground) which is able to stop running transaction after specified amount of time.
 It's way how more then one resource could be part of one ACID transaction (DB + JMS + Mail service create one txn)
 setRollbackOnly() - this know to do EntityTransaction as well but it's just for one resource
--

== JTA a bit on history
 * Implementation of X/Open XA architecture (JSR 907)
 * Versions
 ** 1.0 - year 2000
 ** 1.1 - year 2007 (EE 5)
 ** 1.2 - year 2013 (EE 7)

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Java Transaction API ensures that we can use XA transactions (2PC)
 * X/Open XA - open group for distributed transaction processing (DTP)
 * 1.0 - All the stuff (UserTransaction)
 * 1.1 - TransactionSynchronizationRegistry - used by component like JPA to registry in order and being able to manage transaction on the registred hook
 * 1.2 - @Transactional, @TransactionScoped - ripping transaction of the EJB (with CDI to CDI beans, Servlet, JAX-RS...)
--

== Specifications - a bit messy
 * JTA (JSR 907) maps XA spec to Java
 * XA spec from year 1991 by The Open Group
 * JTS spec maps OTS spec to Java
 * OTS spec by Object management Group (OMG)
 * JCA, JMS, JDBC, Java EE Platform spec contains sections on TM
 * WS-AT and WS-BA under OASIS standard

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 There is no central place with information about transactions in Java
 JTS specifies the implementation of a transaction manager which supports the JTA specification at the high-level and implements the Java mapping of the OMG Object Transaction Service (OTS) 1.1 Specification at the low-level.
 JTS uses the CORBA OTS interfaces for interopertability and portability.
 JSR - Java Community Process :)
--

== Implementations

 *Transaction Manager*

 * Narayana JBoss TM (Arjuna formerly)
 * Atomikos
 * Bitronix
 * Glassfish reference implementation
 * ...

image:{images}/narayana-logo.png[]

== JTA vs. JTS

JTA is to JDBC as JTS is to the database driver

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 JTA is higher level api which uses application server, JTS is internal (low-level) api of TM how to communicate and manage transactional context.
 The JTA is the interface developers use to manage transactions.
 The Java Transaction Service (JTS) is the Java language mapping of the CORBA OTS 1.1 Specification (Object Transaction Service) - defines how to propagate transactions between multiple JTS transaction managers.
 The Java Transaction Service (JTS), on the other hand, is an underlying transaction service that implements JTA.
 Think of the relationship between JTA and JTS as similar to the relationship between JDBC and the corresponding underlying database driver; JTA is to JDBC as JTS is to the database driver.
 JTS - used in CORBA where IIOP protocol to propagate transaction between multipe JTS TMs
--

== JTA API overview

 * UserTransaction
 * TransactionManager
 * Status
 * Transaction
 * Synchronization
 * TransactionSynchronizationRegistry
 * XAResource

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 UserTransaction for user
 TransactionManager for app server
 UserTransaction is mapped by spec to java:comp/UserTransaction jndi space
 TransactionManager is not specified where it resides
 If you want to add some synchronization then you need to take Transaction instance from TransactionManager :/
 Transaction instance means the transaction context in fact (flows from one bean to another)
--

= JPA

== JPA overview in short

 * ORM (Object-relational mapping)
 * EclipseLink (reference), Hibernate (JBoss)
 * Benefits (theoretically)
 ** staying in object oriented world
 ** independent on underlaying database
 ** simplified CRUD
 ** JPQL (db independent + simplified join queries)
 ** automatic table creation (hbm2dll)
 ** performance (lazy dml, batching sql, 2nd level cache)

 What I understand when I define dialect and use hibernate.temp.use_jdbc_metadata_defaults then Hibernate does not need to ask for metatadata
 from the database and there are not done some first quering of database
 Beside jta-data-source there is tag non-jta-data-source bug JBoss(WildFly 8.2) does not respect this and it only depends what is underlayin datasource
 if datasource is jta=false then it always (doesn't matter what is tag for) used as non-transactional from TM point of view (autocommit=true)
 if datasource is jta=true then it's joint to global TM if exists

[NOTE.speaker]

 EntityManager instance is 1st level cache. It contains all data that we used and it run SQLs to update database
 just if it' necessary (it's lazy DML)
 * em.flush()
 * em.close() (application managed and extended-scoped pc)
 * on commit transaction
 * when using query and some entities are dirty
 * driven by FlushModeType 
 ** AUTO as stated above (default)
 ** COMMIT only on transaction commit (queries could get stale data)
 Hibernate implementation does add MANUAL, NEVER, ALWAYS, PERSISTENCE_CONTEXT... see javadoc

 in Java EE em.clear() is called at the end of transaction
 in Java SE the context (entity manager) is not cleared and it's up to developer when it should be cleared
   if context is full of data we can do some change of one particular item/record/entity and all other data
   which we don't know about their existence could be published to database simultaneouslly

 after clear() is called (or em is closed) the entities are detached and for the next usage it's need to
 be attached to some entity manager (persitence context) by em.merge(entity_instance)
--

== Transactions in JPA

 * Transaction management defined by transaction-type (persistence.xml)
 * Connected with persistence context type
 * Any update operation has to be proceeded inside of a transaction
 * Read operation could be proceeded out of the transaction

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 In Java SE working with EntityTransaction, in Java EE with global transaction. It's problematic to use autocommit=true.
 In fact autocommit=true is probably (!) used when NOT_SUPPORTED for transaction is used. For Java SE it's probably(!) necessary
 to directly touch underlaying connection as normally EntityTransaction has to be started and it's not possible to change it by some
 easily accesible settings or API.

 NOTE: all this tested on PostgreSQL
--

== Persistence context types

 * Application-managed
 ** RESOURCE_LOCAL/Java SE
 ** ends (is cleared) on manual call of clear method or em.remove(entity)
 * Container-managed Transaction-scoped
 ** ends at the end of transaction
 * Container-managed Extended
 ** used only with SFSB
 ** ends when SFSB method `@Remove` is called
 ** during the time several transactions could be committed

  Java SE is not precondition here but it's standard to do it so. The application managed is more bound to
  transaction-type attribute where here it's resource local

  Persistence context type is set by @PersistenceContext annotation and types like PersistenceContextType.TRANSACTION (default)
  and PersistenceContextType.EXTENDED

  When persitence context ends then it's flushed and cleared = all entities started to be detached

== How to get the method being transactional

 * EJB method is transactional by default
 * CDI - `@Transactional`
 * Tog get it
 ** `@Resource/@Inject  UserTransaction utx;`
 ** `@Resource  SessionContext ctx;`
 ** `java:comp/UserTransaction`
 ** `java:jboss/TransactionManager`

[NOTE.speaker]

 There could be one difference in @Resource and @Inject. WildFly checks whether @Resource annotation is used in EJB sesion or message driven bean when bean demarcation is specifie. 
 UserTransaction is not permitted to be used in any other location (EjbExeption - IllegalStateException -JBAS011048: Failed to construct component instance)
 You can't access UserTransaction interface either with use of SessionContext when you are not in bean managed demarcation (WildFly 8.2)
 But by @Inject you can inject transaction in whatever location you want in general.

= EJB Bean-managed transactions

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Either in BMT or CMT we still touches global transaction managed by transaction manager. That's important to understand.
 Programatic approach
--

= Bean-managed transaction

[ source, language="java" ]
----
 @Resource
 SessionContext ctx;

 public void method(){
   try {
      UserTransaction utx = ctx.getUserTransaction();
      utx.begin();
      ...
      utx.commit();
   } catch(Exception e) {
      utx.rollback();
   }
 }
----

= Limitation of usage

 * Session beans (@Stateful, @Stateless, @Singleton)
 * SFSB which implements SessionSynchronization can't use BTM (TODO: SLSB could?)
 * Message driven beans (@MessageDriven)
 * Entity bean (EJB 2.0) can be only CMT

 A bit tricky :) here. Session bean is CONTAINER managed by default.
 This will throw an EjbException

 * Still in EJB container which ensures that transaction won't leave a method uncommitted.
 ** IllegalStateException or rollback (MDB?) will be thrown (TODO: ensure this :)
 ** true for @Stateless and @MessageDriven
 ** *not true* for @Stateful beans
 ** TODO: what @Singleton and what @CDI

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Limitation of @Stateless bean to commit transaction came from the fact (probably) that nested transactions
 are not supported by JTA.

== Quiz - Answer

 Nothing will happen (TODO: ensure this as there could be transaction thrown in fact :). Transaction timeout has to be set before transaction is started.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Default jboss transaction timeout is 5 minutes (default-timeout of transactions subsystem).
--

== Exception handling

 In difference from CMT you need to handled it on your own (at least partly).

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 When RuntimeException is thrown from another bean - ie. when setRollbackOnly flag is set then then transaction can't be commited.
 When you run commit you got Throwable and when you catch it and try to rollback then you get EjbException - no transaction!
 But in fact transaction seems to be really rollbacked. So some automatic handling is available.
--

== Message Driven Bean

 * transaction context does not flow with a JMS message
 * handled by JCA in-flow protocol

 * Bean managed transaction
 ** message receive is not part of tranaction
 ** you can start new transaction inside of onMessage method but received message is already acknowledged
 * Container managed transaction
 ** REQUIRED - new transaction at onMessage method start
 ** NOT_SUPPORTED - no transaction - acknowledge mode


= EJB Container-managed transactions

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Declarative approach
--

== Annotations under use

 * @TransactionManagement
 * @TransactionAttribute
 * @TransactionTimeout
 * @ApplicationException

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 @TransactionManagement - CONTAINER, BEAN (container is by default)
 @TransactionAttribute - REQUIRED, REQUIRES_NEW... (required is by default)
 @TransactionTimeout is jboss specific annotation - not part of EJB spec
 @ApplicationException is put to user exception (standard or runtime) and defines if such exception should cause the rollback or not
   (RuntimeException could be marked for not causing the rollback)

 Each method is associated with *one* transaction. Neither nested or multiple transactions are not permitted.
--

== Transaction attributes

 * REQUIRED
 * REQUIRES_NEW
 * MANDATORY
 * NOT_SUPPORTED
 * SUPPORTS
 * NEVER

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Resource: http://entjavastuff.blogspot.cz/2011/02/ejb-transaction-management-going-deeper.html
 Attributes
 * REQUIRED - no txn then new transaction is started or joining to existing txn
 * REQUIRES_NEW - new transaction is started anytime
    - outer transaction is put to sleep until the inner EJB call finishes
    - note that the inner transaction does not share the managed entities of the outer transaction, they are completely isolated
 * MANDATORY - no txn then EjbTransactionRequiredException or joining the existing txn
   - powerful tool that can help you to make your transactional code so much more robust - e.g. mark storage DAO methods that accept (managed) entities as a parameter as MANDATORY
 * NOT_SUPPORTED - method runs without transaction anytime (no txn then nothing is done or suspend running txn)
   What could be useful for:
   - documentation. The annotation instantly tells you that the method does nothing transactional.
   - resources. There is always a cost in managing a transaction, so if the container doesn't have to, give it a break.
   - decreased whoops factor.  you'll catch transaction mistakes far sooner in your development cycle
 * SUPPORTS - no txn then nothing is done (method runs without txn) or joining the existing txn
    - container is lazy :)
 * NEVER - no txn then nothing is done (method runs without txn) or EjbException if calling method propagates some started txn
    - can be a useful tool to catch programming mistakes early on
    - when you make a call to another EJB, that EJB may safely create its own isolated transaction - NEVER may actually become a performance hog because of many mini-transactions being created

    DataSource datasource;

    public void insertMethod() {
        try(Connection connection = datasource.getConnection()) {
            Statement st = connection.createStatement();

            ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
            if(rs.next()) {
                return rs.getObject(1).toString();

            ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery("SELECT name FROM table WHERE id = 1");
            String eapName = null;
            if(rs.next()) {
              eapName = rs.getString(1) + " 7";

 We should close the connection on ours own. But in case the application server should close it for us at the end.
 Btw. closing does not mean real closing. It just returns connection to pool.

 TODO: try this example as a real testcase! (I would like know what cannection we will get by datasource - the same one?)
--

== Exception handling

 Exception which causes rollback (setRollbackOnly is called)

 * RuntimeException
 * EjbException
 * @ApplicationException(rollback = true, inherited = true)

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 EjbException extends RuntimeException, so...
 intherited is from EJB 3.1

 TODO: test this :)
--

== Transaction context propagation

 * propagation works from BMT to CMT
 * NOT propagated to BMT
 ** transaction from BMT is suspended

= CDI transactional management

== @Transactional and @TransactionScoped

 * @Transactional
 ** javax.transaction.TxType value
 ** Class[] rollbackOn
 ** Class[] dontRollbackOn

 * @TransactionScoped

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Exception handling - RuntimeException should cause the rollback is provided. But there is a question that I do not know
   that injected CDI bean inside other CDI bean does not cause that the transaction would be marked as rollback only.

 JCA multiple datasources in XA
 JCA - Using tracking=true will make it scream... Assuming you are inside a transaction... WildFly doesn't make use of IronJacamar's tracking feature by default. Further details at http://www.ironjacamar.org/doc/roadto12/txtracking.html
