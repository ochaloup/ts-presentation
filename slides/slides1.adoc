== Agenda
 * Terminology
 * Resource local transaction in Java SE
 ** Database
 ** JMS
 * Global transaction in Java SE
 ** Java Transaction API (JTA)
 ** Narayana implementation
 * Transactions in Java EE
 ** Bean managed transactions (BMT)
 ** Container managed transactions (CMT)


= Terminology corner

== A transaction
A transaction is a group of business logic statements with certain shared properties.

One or more of:

Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 The statement above stolen from presentation of Michael Musgrove for Brno JBug, January 2015
 From user point of view a transaction is an atomic unit of the work where everything or nothing is finished.
--

=== ACID
 * Atomicity
 * Consistency
 * Isolation
 * Durablitity

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID, http://what-when-how.com/hibernate/transactions-and-concurrency-hibernate/
 Atomicity
  * one part of transaction fails then whole transaction fails
  * the notion that all operations are executed as an atomic unit
 Consistency
  * transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another according to defined rules (as constraints, cascades, triggers...)
  * consistency means that a transaction works on a consistent set of data: a set of data that is hidden from other concurrently running transactions
     and that is left in a clean and consistent state after the transactions completes
  * does not mean correctness of transaction from business point of view
 Isolation
  * for transaction itself the system behaves like the paralel transactions would be run in serial order
  * concurrent execution of transactions results in a system state that would be obtained if transactions were executed serially (one by one)
 Durablitity
  * durability means that once a transaction completes, all changes made during that transaction become persistent and aren’t lost even if the system subsequently fails

== Other transaction "types"
 * BA (Business Activities)
 * BTP
 * WS-CAF
 * WS-TX (WA-AT and WS-BA)
 * Extended transactions
 * BASE

  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR8_m5_k4fQ
  * http://www.infoq.com/articles/History-of-Extended-Transactions
  Extended transactions (in Narayana)
   * umbrella term for transaction systems/protocols which relax some of the ACID guarantees (properties)
   * from part of Narayana it's protocol based on Sagus (academic research from 1997)
   ** relaxes Isolation and Consistency (it's eventually consistent)
  BA - business activities
   * BA is term from "another" world - in general it's long terming transaction (booking a flight + taxi from the airport)
   * came along with WebServices
  BTP
   * Hewlett-Packard, Oracle and BEA worked on the OASIS Business Transaction Protocol (BTP), which was aimed at business-to-business transactions in loosely coupled domains such as Web Services
   * based on 2PC protocol in general
   * The specification developed two new models for "transactions", requiring business-level decisions to be incorporated within the transaction infrastructure
   * 2001
  WS-CAF
   * ASIS Web Services Composite Application Framework (WS-CAF) TC (Defining an open framework for supporting coordinated and transactional compositions of multiple Web services applications)
   * 2006
  WS-TX
   * ideas came from CORBA model (http://www.infoq.com/articles/History-of-Extended-Transactions)
   ** coordinator responsible for sending and receiving messages of arbitrary types - called signals
   ** coordinator inteligence - enabled for specific protocol with special sets of signals being transfered
   * WS-AT: atomic transactions - 2PC
   * WS-BA: businness activities doing compensation actions
  BASE
   * ACID transaction doesn't scale
   * connected with the movement of NoSQL
   * came with CAP theorem - system could satisfy just two of these three requirements: Consistency, Availability, Parition Tolerance
   * one of the way how to handle CAP "trouble" is relaxing consistency which is where BASE goes
   ** Basic Availability -  spread data across many storage systems with a high degree of replication
   ** Soft State. - data consistency is the developer's problem and should not be handled by the database, consistency is not a goal here
   ** Eventual Consistency - system will eventually become consistent once it stops receiving input
   * some of the NoSQL databases tries to be ACID(like) -> NewSQL - FoundationDB, NuoDB, OrientDB...

== JTA vs. JTS

JTA is to JDBC as JTS is to the database driver

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 JTA and JTS
 The JTA is the interface developers use to manage transactions.
 The Java Transaction Service (JTS) is the Java language mapping of the CORBA OTS 1.1 Specification (Object Transaction Service) - defines how to propagate transactions between multiple JTS transaction managers.
 The Java Transaction Service (JTS), on the other hand, is an underlying transaction service that implements JTA.
 Think of the relationship between JTA and JTS as similar to the relationship between JDBC and the corresponding underlying database driver; JTA is to JDBC as JTS is to the database driver.
--
== Transaction "types" (transaction manager point of view)
 * Resource local
 * Global transaction
 * Distributed transaction

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Txn management
 * Resource local - transaction at level of database or JMS server
 * Global - transaction "consisting" from several resource local transactions managed by transaction manager
 * Distributed transaction - transaction spread over multiple transaction managers
--

== Transactions from developer point of view
 * Local transaction model
   `connection.commit`
 * Programmatic transaction model
   `transaction.commit()`
 * Declarative transaction model
   `@TransactionAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRED)`

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 * Local - working directly with resource/connection
 * Programmatic - not working with resource but with a transaction
 * Declarative - transactions are hidden behind of JEE layer
--

== Transaction types
 * Nested transaction
 * TODO...

= Databases and JDBC

== Database transaction
[ source, language="sql" ]
----
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO test_table VALUES (1, 'test');
COMMIT;

== Isolation level
image:{images}/db/isolation-levels-base.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Resources
   * http://what-when-how.com/hibernate/transactions-and-concurrency-hibernate/#bookmark369
   * Java Transaction Design Strategy p53
 It's interaction of interleaving transactions
 Transaction isolation is a function of database cocurrency and database consistency - more isolation, means more consistency but less concurrency
 Hibernate increase level of isolation to moving control to application layer
  * optimistic locking adds versioning and so non-repeatable reads can't occur (or the special case when second commit replaces data of first commit)
  * pesimistic locking uses SELECT ... FOR UPDATE to lock particular record in database
--

== Lost update
image:{images}/db/01-lost-update.jpg[]

[small]#kindly stolen from http://what-when-how.com#

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 two transactions doing update in parallel but first does commit and second rollbacks - then the commit of first willl be lost
--

== Dirty reads
image:{images}/db/02-dirty-reads.jpg[]

[small]#kindly stolen from http://what-when-how.com#

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 two transactions running in paralel. first does update and second shortly after that reads the same data - the update will be wisible
 despite the fact that the first transaction is rollbacked in a while
--

== Non-repeatable reads
image:{images}/db/03-non-repeatable-reads[]

[small]#kindly stolen from http://what-when-how.com#

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 when first transaction does two reads of some data already saved! in transaction - one after another - and between these two actions second transaction does commit
 the second read of the first transaction will get another data then the first read
--

== Phantom reads
image:{images}/db/04-phantom-reads.jpg[]

[small]#kindly stolen from http://what-when-how.com#

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 when transaction does select over more rows it could reads different count of rows in two subsequent queries when another transaction was meanwhile commited and
 added a row which is contained in the searched query
--

== Quiz #1
[ source, language="java" ]
----
java.sql.Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(...)
Statement st = connection.createStatement();
st.execute("INSERT INTO table VALUES (1, 'EAP QE')");
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Where is the transaction?
--

== Quiz #1 - Answer
[ source, language="java" ]
----
java.sql.Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(...)
connection.setAutoCommit(false);
Statement st = connection.createStatement();
st.execute("INSERT INTO table VALUES (1, 'EAP QE')");
connection.commit();
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Where is the transaction?
--

== JDBC
 * Connection.setAutoCommit
 * Connection.setTransactionIsolation

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 * transactions are managed by Connection.setAutoCommit method
--

== JDBC batch
[ source, language="java" ]
----
java.sql.Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(...)
connection.setAutoCommit(false);
Statement st = connection.createStatement();
st.addBatch("INSERT INTO table VALUES (1, 'JTA')");
st.addBatch("INSERT INTO table VALUES (2, 'JCA')");
int[] updateCounts = st.executeBatch();
connection.commit();
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Some performance optimalizations for batching could be taken by database.
 But from test log there is no any special handling for simple cases as this one.
 There are just two inserts one after another.
--

== JDBC "nested" transactions
[ source, language="java" ]
----
java.sql.Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(...)
connection.setAutoCommit(false);
Statement st = connection.createStatement();
st.execute("INSERT INTO table VALUES (1, 'EAP 6')");
Savepoint savePoint = connection.setSavepoint();
st.execute("UPDATE table SET product='EAP 7' WHERE id=1");
connection.rollback(savePoint);
connection.commit();
----

== Be aware of DDL commands
 * DDL - data definition language (CREATE, DROP...)
 * DML - data manipulation language (INSERT, UPDATE...)
 * lot of Databases does not support transactional DDL

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Resource:
 https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Transactional_DDL_in_PostgreSQL:_A_Competitive_Analysis
 PostgreSQL do DDL in transaction
 e.g. Oracle (probably - not up-to-date info) first commits currently running DML and then does DDL in separate transaction
--

= JMS

== Transactions and redelivery
image:{images}/jms/jms-transaction-redelivery.png[]


[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Resources: http://www.javaworld.com/article/2074123/java-web-development/transaction-and-redelivery-in-jms.html
 First - simplifiyng abilities of JMS
 Second - aim is that we want being safe thta message was really delivered
 * if message waits in queue (in JMS provider) then the its fate in case of failure depends on delivery mode: *persistent* or *nonpersistent*
 ** HornetQ settings: <persistence-enabled>true</persistence-enabled>
 * if message is being sent then acknowledgement that was received is driven by by transaction/redelivery modes
 * all this is set when *Session* is created
--

== Session creation
[ source, language="java" ]
----
Connection.createSession(boolean transacted, int acknowledgeMode)
---
 * `Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE`
 * `Session.DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE`
 * `Session.CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE`
 * `Session.SESSION_TRANSACTED`

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 If session is set as transacted = true then acknowledgeMode is ignored
 Or at least it should be - this is not true for Genereic JMS RA (Tibco and EAP)
 * commit() is called on Session (transacted=true)
 * acknowledge() is called Message (transacted=false, acknowledgeMode=CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE)
--

== Transacted session and rollback
 * automatic redelivery rollbacked messages
 * redelivery count could be defined
 * redelivery timeout could be defined
 * exceptional destination (message is non-deliverable)
 ** message is only logged
 ** message is forwarded to an error destination
 ** message is forgotten

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 redelivery count - number of tries to deliver message, redelivery count is important as not deliverable messages can eventually crash the system
 redelivery timeout - time to wait before redelivering the message. This delay lets the JMS provider and the application recover to a stable state.
 when rollback it could be set whether rollbacked message goes to the end or to the front of the queue - it depends on some config etc.
--

= JPA

== abc

= Java EE

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Ideas to check:
  * MDB and BMT
  * JCA multiple datasources in XA
  * history of JTA vs. Narayana versions vs EE versions
