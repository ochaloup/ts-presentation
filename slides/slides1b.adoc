= Transaction Management in Java EE
Ondra Chaloupka / ochaloup@redhat.com

== There is a transaction?

image:{images}/entertain/wtf.jpg[]

== Summary - Terminology

 * ACID (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable)
 * Resource local vs. Global vs. Distributed
 * XA is (not) Distributed transaction

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Transactions summary from slides1.adoc session
 * We are talking about ACID transactions - need to know - no other txn is discussed here
 * Resource local is transaction of resource (DB, JMS), Global is txn managed by outter entity (e.g. TM), distributed is having transaction context flowing through multiple TMs
 * for Narayana speak we difference XA and Distributed - more resources could be part of a XA transaction, distributed means the transaction is spread over more TM
--

== Summary - DB and JMS

 * Databases
 ** relaxing isolation for better concurrency
 ** `setAutoCommit(false)`
 ** DDL commands are not transactional in all DBs

 * JMS
 ** `Connection.createSession(boolean transacted, int acknowledgeMode)`

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Databases and JMS
 * Transaction isolation is a function of database cocurrency and database consistency - more isolation, means more consistency but less concurrency
 * how to start longer transaction by JDBC call - setautocommit (e.g. postgres run any SQL query in transaction but if we want a transaction being spread over more SQL commands then we use setautocommit to false)
--

== Summary - JTA

 * XA specification in Java
 ** more resources enlisted in one global transaction
 * implemented by Transaction manager (TM)
 * Transaction manager works with XAResource
 * Java EE hides transactions from developer


[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Java app server hides transaction from developer
 * CMT - you are expected not to touch anything and just define behaviour by annotations
 * BMT - you are exepected to inject UserTransaction and use it
--

== JTA vs. JTS


Difference of JTA to JTS has parallel in difference of JDBC to database driver.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 JTA is higher level api which uses application server, JTS is internal (low-level) api of TM how to communicate and manage transactional context.
 The JTA is the interface developers use to manage transactions.
 The Java Transaction Service (JTS) is the Java language mapping of the CORBA OTS 1.1 Specification (Object Transaction Service) - defines how to propagate transactions between multiple JTS transaction managers.
 The Java Transaction Service (JTS), on the other hand, is an underlying transaction service that implements JTA.
 Think of the relationship between JTA and JTS as similar to the relationship between JDBC and the corresponding underlying database driver; JTA is to JDBC as JTS is to the database driver.
 JTS - used in CORBA where IIOP protocol to propagate transaction between multipe JTS TMs

 JTA is to JDBC as JTS is to the database driver

== Transactions in Java EE

image:{images}/entertain/pocitac.jpg[]

== How to be transactional

 * EJB 
 ** CMT - transactional by default
 ** BMT - not transactional: `UserTransaction`
 * CDI - not transactional: `@Transactional`
 * WebServlet - not transactional: `UserTransaction`

== How to get transaction

 * `@Resource/@Inject UserTransaction utx`
 * `@Resource SessionContext ctx
    ctx.getUserTransaction()`
 * jndi: `java:comp/UserTransaction`

 * jndi: `java:jboss/TransactionManager`
 * `@Resource TransactionSynchronizationRegistry reg`

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 There could be one difference in @Resource and @Inject. WildFly checks whether @Resource annotation is used in EJB sesion or message driven bean when bean demarcation is specified.
 UserTransaction is not permitted to be used in any other location (EjbExeption - IllegalStateException -JBAS011048: Failed to construct component instance)
 You can't access UserTransaction interface either with use of SessionContext when you are not in bean managed demarcation (WildFly 8.2)
 But by @Inject you can inject transaction in whatever location you want in general.
 @Resource could be used in Servlet.

 UserTransaction can't be injected to EJB when it's CMT - you will get EjbException and application won't work
 CMT could inject TransactionManager though

 Jndi for user transaction is defined by spec. Jndi for transaction manager is container specific.
--

== EJB Bean-managed transactions

[ source, language="java" ]
----
 @Stateless
 @TransactionManagement(TransactionManagementType.BEAN)
 public void MyBean {
   @Resource
   SessionContext ctx;

   public void method(){
     try {
        UserTransaction utx = ctx.getUserTransaction();
        utx.begin();
        ...
        utx.commit();
     } catch(Exception e) {
        utx.rollback();
     }
   }
 }
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Either in BMT or CMT we still touches global transaction managed by transaction manager. That's important to understand.
 Programatic approach
--

== Bean-managed limitations

 * Session beans (@Stateful, @Stateless, @Singleton)
 * Message driven beans (@MessageDriven)
 * Entity bean (EJB 2.0) can only be CMT
 * Stateful beans can't use SessionSynchronization

== EJB Container-managed transactions

[ source, language="java" ]
----
 @Stateless
 @TransactionManagement(TransactionManagementType.CONTAINER)
 public class MyBean {
    @TransactionAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRED)
    public void method() {
        // work with application managed resource
    }
 }
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Declarative approach
 * mentioned annotations are not needed as they are default for a bean
 *  work with application managed resource
    working directly e.g. with a database connection or jms session won't bring you transactional guarantees
--

== Annotations under use

 * @TransactionManagement
 ** CONTAINER
 ** BEAN
 * @TransactionAttribute
 * @TransactionTimeout
 * @ApplicationException

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 @TransactionManagement - CONTAINER, BEAN (container is by default)
 @TransactionAttribute - REQUIRED, REQUIRES_NEW... (required is by default)
 @TransactionTimeout is jboss specific annotation - not part of EJB spec
 @ApplicationException is put to user exception (standard or runtime) and defines if such exception should cause the rollback or not
   (RuntimeException could be marked for not causing the rollback)

 Each method is associated with *one* transaction. Neither nested or multiple transactions are not permitted.
--

== Transaction attributes

 * REQUIRED
 * REQUIRES_NEW
 * MANDATORY
 * NOT_SUPPORTED
 * SUPPORTS
 * NEVER

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Resource: http://entjavastuff.blogspot.cz/2011/02/ejb-transaction-management-going-deeper.html
 Attributes
 * REQUIRED - no txn then new transaction is started or joining to existing txn
 * REQUIRES_NEW - new transaction is started anytime
    - outer transaction is put to sleep until the inner EJB call finishes
    - note that the inner transaction does not share the managed entities of the outer transaction, they are completely isolated
 * MANDATORY - no txn then EjbTransactionRequiredException or joining the existing txn
   - powerful tool that can help you to make your transactional code so much more robust - e.g. mark storage DAO methods that accept (managed) entities as a parameter as MANDATORY
 * NOT_SUPPORTED - method runs without transaction anytime (no txn then nothing is done or suspend running txn)
   What could be useful for:
   - documentation. The annotation instantly tells you that the method does nothing transactional.
   - resources. There is always a cost in managing a transaction, so if the container doesn't have to, give it a break.
   - decreased whoops factor.  you'll catch transaction mistakes far sooner in your development cycle
 * SUPPORTS - no txn then nothing is done (method runs without txn) or joining the existing txn
    - container is lazy :)
 * NEVER - no txn then nothing is done (method runs without txn) or EJBException if calling method propagates some started txn
    - can be a useful tool to catch programming mistakes early on
    - when you make a call to another EJB, that EJB may safely create its own isolated transaction - NEVER may actually become a performance hog because of many mini-transactions being created

 When there is not transaction context active (ie. NOT_SUPPORTED) then for JMS autoack should be used and for database autoCommit is true.

== Component interactions overview

image:{images}/ee/ee-component-iteractions.png[]

== Exception handling

* CMT - Exceptions which cause rollback
** RuntimeException
** EJBException
** @ApplicationException(rollback = true, inherited = true)

* BMT
** exceptions should be managed by developer

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 CMT:
 EJBException extends RuntimeException, so...
 intherited added to spec from EJB 3.1
 BMT:
 When RuntimeException is thrown from another bean - ie. when setRollbackOnly flag is set then then transaction can't be commited.
 When you run commit you got Throwable and when you catch it and try to rollback then you get EJBException - no transaction!
 But in fact transaction seems to be really rollbacked. So some automatic handling is available.
--

== Message Driven Bean

[ source, language="java" ]
----
 @MessageDriven(name = "MyMDB",
   activationConfig = {
      @ActivationConfigProperty( propertyName = "destinationType",
                                 propertyValue = "javax.jms.Queue"),
      @ActivationConfigProperty( propertyName = "destination", 
                                 propertyValue ="/queue/testQueue")
   }
)
public class LibraryMessageBean implements MessageListener {

   @Resource
   private MessageDrivenContext mdctx;

   @EJB
   MyBean bean;

   public void onMessage(Message message) {
      // do something with the received message
   }
}
----

== Message Driven Bean - Bean-managed transactions

 * handled by JCA in-flow protocol

 * Bean managed transaction
 ** message receive is not part of transaction
 ** you can start new transaction inside of onMessage method but received message is already acknowledged

 * Container managed transaction
 ** REQUIRED - new transaction at onMessage method start
 ** NOT_SUPPORTED - no transaction - acknowledge mode

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 transaction context does not flow with a JMS message - this means that it should be duty of RA to manage transactions here

        // utx.commit(); <---
     } catch(Exception e) {
        utx.rollback();
     }
   }
 }
----

 A bit tricky :) here. Session bean is CONTAINER managed by default.
 This will throw an EJBException

     } catch(Exception e) {
        utx.rollback();
     }
   }
 }
----

== Quiz - Answer - no commit BMT!

 * Stateless, Singleton, MDB: EJB container ensures that transaction won't leave a method uncommitted
 ** EJBException ("should complete transaction before returning") + rollback done by container
 * Stateful: transaction can flow over several method invocations on the same SFSB instance

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Limitation of @Stateless bean to commit transaction came from the fact (probably) that nested transactions
 are not supported by JTA (<- really not sure with this statement)

 For stateful bean the transaction could be span e.g. over several http calls.

     } catch(Exception e) {
        ut.rollback();
     }
   }

----

== Quiz - Answer

Nothing will happen. Transaction timeout has to be set before the transaction is started.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 Default jboss transaction timeout is 5 minutes (default-timeout of transactions subsystem).

----

== Quiz - CMT with REQUIRES_NEW

[ source, language="java" ]
----
 @Stateless
 public class MyBean {

    public void createNewUser(String name) {
      UserEntity user = new UserEntity(name);
      em.persist(user);

      long numberOfUsersBeforeCommit = getNumberOfUsers();
    }

    @TransactionAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRES_NEW)
    public long getNumberOfUsers() {
      String sql = "SELECT COUNT(u.id) FROM UserEntity u";
      Query q = em.createQuery(sql);
      return (long) q.getSingleResult();
    }
 }
----

[NOTE.speaker]

      Query q = em.createQuery(sql);
      return (long) q.getSingleResult();
    }
 }
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
  As method was called internally there was no container callback available so the
  new transaction was not created.
  We need to inject bean for container would hook to it and could process annotations.
--

== Quiz - REQUIRES_NEW and JPA

[ source, language="java" ]
----
 @Stateless
 public class MyBean {
    @EJB
    private CityFinder cityBean;

    public void create(String name, String cityName) {

----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
  Will this work?
  Inspired at http://entjavastuff.blogspot.cz/2011/02/ejb-transaction-management-going-deeper.html
--

== Quiz - Answer

City is found in a new transaction. Entity manager is closed at the end of that transaction -
at the end of method `findCity`.

*Result:* Entity became detached.

Detached `CityEntity` reference is being set to managed `UserEntity`.



== Quiz - CMT exception handling

[ source, language="java" ]

 @Stateless
 public class MyBean {
    @EJB
    private MyBean thisBean;

    public void createNewUser(String name) {
      try {
        thisBean.doSomeWork();
      } catch (Exception e) {
        log.warn("The work failed but we will still create user for you");
      }

      UserEntity entity = new UserEntity(name);
      em.persist(entity);
    }

    public long doSomeWork() {
      // do some business but unfortunatelly something goes wrong...
      throw new RuntimeException();
    }
 }
----

== Quiz - Answer

The transaction is marked as setRollbackOnly.

As RuntimeException surpassed the bean boundaries and container will mark it for rollback.

*Result:* transaction will be rollbacked despite catching the exception.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 We should close the connection on ours own. But in case the application server should close it for us at the end.
 Btw. closing does not mean real closing. It just returns connection to pool.

 Expecting that datasource and the entity manager are configured to use the same datasource (sharing connection in fact).

 If table already existed then as same database is used the internal DB transction is aborted and when we try to do some actions we
 would get information that it's not possible as the DB transaction is in abort state.
   Caused by: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block

== Quiz - WebServlet

[ source, language="java" ]

        throws ServletException, IOException {
      bean.doWork();
    }
 }
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 What could be wrong here?
 Stateful will be injected only once and as Servlet behaves as singleton - one instance manages more http requests
 then you can be surprised that not each session or http request gets its own SFSB
 The similar is for @Inject as default scope is @Dependent that behaves like @EJB - it injects CDI bean to servlet
 and the CDI bean is removed when the component (WebServlet) is removed

 User transaction object is thread safe and the transaction is used from different threads
 so this will work fine thread safe means that transaction is bound to a thread {@link ThreadLocal} and it's
 not problem for TM that one single instance of WebServlet manages more user requests

 Exception handling - RuntimeException should cause the rollback is provided. But there is a question that I do not know
   that injected CDI bean inside other CDI bean does not cause that the transaction would be marked as rollback only.

 From testing point of view where different databases are used is necessary to know which xa-datasource-property is used
 in what jdbc driver (e.g. Oracle understand the URL property which is jdbc url and no other database does so)

=== Bonus: JPA

image:{images}/entertain/kartoteka1.jpg[]

=== JPA overview in short

 * ORM (Object-relational mapping)
 * EclipseLink (reference), Hibernate (JBoss)
 * Benefits (theoretically)
 ** staying in object oriented world
 ** independent on underlaying database
 ** simplified CRUD
 ** JPQL (db independent + simplified join queries)
 ** automatic table creation (hbm2dll)
 ** performance (lazy dml, batching sql, 2nd level cache)

 TODO: I haven't found a way how to not use a transaction for persist action will be reflected in database.
       Setting autoCommit to true in persistence.xml does not help in this (at least for RESOURCE_LOCAL)
       I think that autoCommit settings is used for JPA when TransactionAttribute NOT_SUPPORTED is used.
 em.getTranaction() is type of EntityTransaction
 em.clear() - clear persistence context

 What I understand when I define dialect and use hibernate.temp.use_jdbc_metadata_defaults then Hibernate does not need to ask for metatadata
 from the database and there are not done some first quering of database
 Beside jta-data-source there is tag non-jta-data-source bug JBoss(WildFly 8.2) does not respect this and it only depends what is underlayin datasource
 if datasource is jta=false then it always (doesn't matter what is tag for) used as non-transactional from TM point of view (autocommit=true)
 if datasource is jta=true then it's joint to global TM if exists

=== em.flush() and em.clear()

  em.getTransaction().begin();
  Person person = em.find(Person.java, 1L);

  em.clear();

 EntityManager instance is 1st level cache. It contains all data that we used and it run SQLs to update database
 just if it' necessary (it's lazy DML)
 * em.flush()
 * em.close() (application managed and extended-scoped pc)
 * on commit transaction
 * when using query and some entities are dirty
 * driven by FlushModeType 
 ** AUTO as stated above (default)
 ** COMMIT only on transaction commit (queries could get stale data)
 Hibernate implementation does add MANUAL, NEVER, ALWAYS, PERSISTENCE_CONTEXT... see javadoc

 in Java EE em.clear() is called at the end of transaction
 in Java SE the context (entity manager) is not cleared and it's up to developer when it should be cleared
   if context is full of data we can do some change of one particular item/record/entity and all other data
   which we don't know about their existence could be published to database simultaneouslly

 after clear() is called (or em is closed) the entities are detached and for the next usage it's need to
 be attached to some entity manager (persitence context) by em.merge(entity_instance)
--

=== Transactions in JPA

 * Transaction management defined by transaction-type (persistence.xml)
 ** RESOURCE_LOCAL
 ** JTA
 * Relatet to type of persistence context
 * Any update operation has to be proceeded inside of a transaction
 * Read operation could be proceeded out of the transaction

[NOTE.speaker]
--
 In Java SE working with EntityTransaction, in Java EE with global transaction. It's problematic to use autocommit=true.
 In fact autocommit=true is probably (!) used when NOT_SUPPORTED for transaction is used. For Java SE it's probably(!) necessary
 to directly touch underlaying connection as normally EntityTransaction has to be started and it's not possible to change it by some
 easily accesible settings or API.

 NOTE: all this tested on PostgreSQL
--

=== Persistence context types

 * Application-managed
 ** RESOURCE_LOCAL/Java SE
 ** ends (is cleared) on manual call of clear method or em.remove(entity)
 * Container-managed: Transaction-scoped
 ** ends at the end of transaction
 * Container-managed: Extended
 ** used only with SFSB
 ** ends when SFSB method `@Remove` is called
 ** during the time several transactions could be committed

[NOTE.speaker]
--
  Java SE is not precondition here but it's standard to do it so. The application managed is more bound to
  transaction-type attribute where here it's resource local

  Persistence context type is set by @PersistenceContext annotation and types like PersistenceContextType.TRANSACTION (default)
  and PersistenceContextType.EXTENDED

  When persitence context ends then it's flushed and cleared = all entities started to be detached
--

=== A side note: locking

 * Optimistic
 ** `@Version` at attribute
 ** `em.lock(person, LockModeType.OPTIMISTIC)`
 * Pesimistic
 ** `em.lock(persion, LockModeType.PESIMISTIC_WRITE)`
